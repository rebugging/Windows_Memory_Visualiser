Live Memory Visualiser - README
=============================

Description:
------------
This is a live memory visualiser written in C for Windows. It tracks allocations and deallocations in a simulated heap, logs the memory state to a JSON file, and visualises it in real-time using an animated HTML page. 

Features:
---------
1. Continuous memory tracking:
   - Allocations and deallocations are logged to memory_log.json every 0.5 seconds.
2. Interactive memory simulation:
   - Press 'a' to allocate a 32B block.
   - Press 'f' to free the last unfreed block.
   - Press 'q' to quit the programme.
3. Animated HTML visualisation:
   - Uses CSS and JavaScript to display blocks with height proportional to size.
   - Green blocks = allocated, Red blocks = freed.
4. Safe memory cleanup:
   - All memory is freed when the programme exits.
5. Optional automatic mode:
   - The programme can be configured to randomly allocate/free blocks for demonstration.

Safety Notes:
-------------
- Unlimited allocations can consume large amounts of memory. Avoid pressing 'a' excessively.
- File writing occurs every 0.5 seconds to memory_log.json. Ensure the file is not locked by another programme.
- If the programme is terminated abruptly, memory is released by Windows but JSON may not be fully updated.
- Designed for Windows; does not use POSIX sockets.

Requirements:
-------------
- Windows OS
- GCC (e.g., via MinGW) for compilation
- Python 3 (for running a local HTTP server to view HTML)
- Web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)

Files:
------
1. Memory_Visualiser_LoggerV2.c - C programme to simulate memory allocations/frees and log to JSON.
2. Mem_VisualiserV2.html - HTML + JS file for animated visualisation.
3. Memory_Visualiser_V2.exe - Compiled Windows executable (optional; source code recommended).
4. memory_log.json - JSON file generated by the C programme.
5. README.txt - this file.

Instructions to Run:
--------------------
Step 1: Compile the C programme
-----------------------------
Open PowerShell or Command Prompt in the folder containing the files:

gcc Memory_Visualiser_LoggerV2.c -o Memory_Visualiser_V2.exe

Step 2: Run the C programme
----------------------------
.\Memory_Visualiser_V2.exe

- The programme will run indefinitely.
- Use keys:
  - 'a' → allocate 32B memory block
  - 'f' → free the last unfreed block
  - 'q' → quit the programme

Step 3: Serve files for the HTML visualiser
--------------------------------------------
Open another terminal in the same folder and run:

python3 -m http.server 8000

This will serve the folder at http://localhost:8000

Step 4: Open the HTML visualisation
-----------------------------------
Open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:8000/Mem_VisualiserV2.html

- The page will fetch memory_log.json every second.
- Blocks will animate as memory is allocated or freed.

Optional: Automatic Mode
------------------------
You can modify Memory_Visualiser_LoggerV2.c to randomly allocate/free blocks in a loop instead of manual keypresses. This will simulate heap activity automatically and continuously.

Notes:
------
- The JSON file is overwritten on every update.
- The HTML visualisation can be refreshed manually or will update automatically if polling is enabled.
- Scaling factor in the HTML file may be adjusted for better visibility of block heights.
